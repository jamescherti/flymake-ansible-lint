The `flymake-ansible-lint` Emacs package provides a Flymake backend for `ansible-lint`.

## Requirements

- [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) >= 6.0.0

## Installation

To install the `flymake-ansible-lint` from MELPA:

1. If you haven't already done so, [add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).

2. Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install `flymake-ansible-lint` from MELPA:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package flymake-ansible-lint
  :ensure t
  :commands flymake-ansible-lint-setup
  :hook (((yaml-ts-mode yaml-mode) . flymake-ansible-lint-setup)
         ((yaml-ts-mode yaml-mode) . flymake-mode)))
```

## customize

You can configure `ansible-lint` parameters using the `flymake-ansible-lint-args` variable:

```emacs-lisp
(setq flymake-ansible-lint-args '("--offline"
                                  "-x" "run-once[play],no-free-form"))
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Why are some ansible-lint error messages truncated?

This issue is a known bug in `ansible-lint`, not in `flymake-ansible-lint`.

It is `ansible-lint` that cuts off error messages:
```
$ ansible-lint -p test.yaml
test.yaml:5: yaml[truthy]: Truthy value should be one of
```

In future versions of `flymake-ansible-lint`, the author plans to utilize `ansible-lint`'s JSON output. This change will enable the parsing of structures like:
```
$ ansible-lint test.yaml -f json
[{"type": "issue", "check_name": "yaml[truthy]", "categories": ["formatting", "yaml"],
"url": "https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/rules/yaml/", "severity": "info",
"level": "error", "description": "Truthy value should be one of \\[false, true]",
"fingerprint": "******************************************",
"location": {"path": "test.yaml", "lines": {"begin": 5}}}]
```

The author will need to refactor the code to implement this. Contributions are welcome.
